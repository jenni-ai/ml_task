This task has 2 parts.

Use the data from train.pickle to train a neural network to maximize the predictive accuracy of "is_correct" column on test.pickle. The data shows users' attempts in answering the given questions, your model should predict if user will answer the question correctly or not. Ensure that your code can reproduce exact same results when rerun, at least on your machine (i.e. set all seeds, etc). It's possible to get 95+% accuracy. 

Overwrite README.md with a experimental report on the work done. Include the information about what you've tried, what have worked and what have not, and any other things you feel like sharing.
