This task has 2 parts.

* Use the data from train.pickle to train a neural network to maximize the predictive accuracy of "is_correct" column on test.pickle. Ensure that your code can reproduce exact same results when rerun, at least on your machine (i.e. set all seeds, etc). It's possible to get 95+% accuracy.

* Overwrite README.md with a report on the work done. Include the information about what you've tried, what have worked and what have not, and any other things you feel like sharing.
